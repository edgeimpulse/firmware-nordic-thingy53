# Edge Impulse firmware for Nordic Semiconductor Thingy:53

[Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com) enables developers to create the next generation of intelligent device solutions with embedded Machine Learning. This repository contains the Edge Impulse firmware for the Nordic Semiconductor Thingy:53 development board that includes a subset of the available sensors, for all of the currently supported sensors see [src/sensors](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/firmware-nordic-thingy53/tree/main/src/sensors). This firmware supports all Edge Impulse features, including ingestion, remote management, and inferencing. Direct communication with the device is performed over a mobile application, but the user can execute all functions via AT command over a USB interface. By including specific build configuration this firmware can be enabled to run with Nordic compatible WiFi external board **nRF7002eb**.

> [!NOTE]  
> This firmware is compatible with **NCS version 2.4.0**

## Building the device firmware (locally)

1. Install the [nRF Connect SDK](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-2.4.0/page/nrf/getting_started/installing.html) in a *separate* folder from this repository (e.g. `~/repos/ncs`).

2. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/edgeimpulse/firmware-nordic-thingy53
    ```

3. Build the application:

    ```bash
    #  Thingy:53 build command
    $ west build -b thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp

    # Thingy:53 with nRF7002eb (WiFi) builf command
    $ west build -b thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002eb 
    ```

## Building the device firmware (Docker)

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/edgeimpulse/firmware-nordic-thingy53
    ```

2. Build the Docker container:

    ```bash
    $ docker build -t edge-impulse-nordic .
    ```

3. Build the application:

    ```bash
    #  Thingy:53 build command
    $ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/app edge-impulse-nordic west build -b thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp

    # Thingy:53 with nRF7002eb (WiFi) builf command
    $ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/app edge-impulse-nordic west build -b thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002eb 
    ```

## Flashing

### Over JLink

1. Connect the JLink to the Thingy:53 as described [in this guide](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/device_guides/working_with_nrf/nrf53/thingy53_gs.html#updating_through_external_debug_probe); if not previously done, erase the chip with:

    ```bash
    $ nrfjprog --recover
    ```

2. Flash the chip, both application core and networking core, with the command:

    ```bash
    $ west flash
    ```

### Over Serial DFU using `mcumgr` CLi tool

1. Connect USB-C to the Thingy:53. Open the enclosure, press the small button (`SW2`) on top of the device and turn the power switch on.

    ![Recovery button location](./docs/recovery-button.png)

2. After the device is on, release the button. The device is now in bootloader mode. For flashing the new firmware, use commands:

    ```
    mcumgr -t 60 --conntype serial --connstring=/dev/ttyACM0 image list
    mcumgr -t 60 --conntype serial --connstring=/dev/ttyACM0 image upload app_update.bin
    ```

### Over Serial DFU using nRF Connect Desktop

Follow the steps from [this guide](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/device_guides/working_with_nrf/nrf53/thingy53_gs.html#updating_through_usb). Instead of precompiled firmware, use the file `build/zephyr/app_signed.hex`.

### Over BLE DFU

#### Use mobile app (Android/iOS)

Use [nRF Connect for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) or [nRF Connect for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403) and `build/zephyr/dfu_application.zip`. After connecting to the device, click on the DFU icon and select the file. When the DFU process is done, the device will boot with the new image.

#### Use `mcumgr`

1. Install [mcumgr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/device_mgmt/mcumgr.html)
2. Upload the firmware (adjust the path to `app_update.bin` and `hci` interface number if you have a few of them)

    ```bash
    mcumgr --conntype ble --hci 0 --connstring peer_name='EdgeImpulse' image upload app_update.bin
    ```

3. Check if the firmware has been uploaded correctly and get the hash of new firmware

    ```bash
    mcumgr --conntype ble --hci 0 --connstring peer_name='EdgeImpulse' image list
    ```

    The output should be similar to the one below; the new image is in slot 1.

    ```
    Images:
    image=0 slot=0
        version: 0.9.9
        bootable: true
        flags: active confirmed
        hash: 67f6f87f3f639217140f9e8073cb28f214499d7f646cb774276496108326a7ba
    image=0 slot=1
        version: 0.9.1
        bootable: true
        flags:
        hash: c218220606d3ecef26dc46ffd7c112e700d08837335516c40ae12f6a86aa7ab2
    Split status: N/A (0)
    ```

4. Test the image and swap the images

    ```
    mcumgr --conntype ble --hci 0 --connstring peer_name='EdgeImpulse' image test <HASH_OF_THE_IMAGE>
    ```

5. Reset the device (may take up to 10-20 seconds)

    ```
    mcumgr --conntype ble --hci 0 --connstring peer_name='EdgeImpulse' reset
    ```
